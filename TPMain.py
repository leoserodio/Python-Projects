But one day, as we were doing a puppet show, a little boy sitting in a chair fell from his seat, uncovering a soccer field below. Except there weren't any goals, only haunted backstage areas which we call 'Puppet black Holes'. They say a beast in human form, 'Ramos', took the soul of this poor little boy, and if you beat him in a soccer match, you can save him. If not, you're doomed until the next one tries... As a puppet master, I was not allowed to play, but you, you my son, are the only one who can save him. Goodbye."
